# Field_Programmable_Multi-Project_Chips_and_Wafer
Project for design and manufacture of Field Programmable Multi Project Chips and Wafers
Creating programatically routed Project Blocks is the next incremental stage in evolution of FPGAs. 
In FPGAs the Configurable Logic Block (CLB) is the fundamental component. Extending the definition of these basic blocks to prebuilt higher order functional components, chiplets and signal processors, significantly simplifies the use of FPGAs and creates an incredibly flexible design.
This project sits at the interseaction of chiplet based integration - multiproject wafers and FPGAs.
By blending these concepts we are creating a new class of component with more sophisticated capabilities, and an incredibly wide range of usecases. 
The value of being able to address and chain together dynamically different chips on a multi-project chip or even multi-project wafer is derived from the ease of use of the chip. It moves the design investment away from the chip end user to specialist groups to focus on project block designs.The underlying routing and progammability of the FPGA remains but now the elements are individual sub chip projects.
The key insight here is that this offers a simplification for creating complex projects while allowing huge flexibility in design of the FPMPC output. We see this being of particular use in AI hardware research. But also of general use to builders and hobbyists
